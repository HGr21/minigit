## Project Overview

**MiniGit** is a simplified version control system built in C++ that mimics Git's core functionalities â€” including file tracking, commits, branching, merging, and viewing diffs. It's designed for educational purposes to demonstrate how Git works under the hood.

## Features

- `init` â€“ Initialise a new MiniGit repository  
- `add <filename>` â€“ Stage a file for the next commit  
- `commit -m "<message>"` â€“ Save a snapshot of the staged files  
- `log` â€“ View commit history  
- `branch <name>` â€“ Create a new branch from the current commit  
- `checkout <branch | commit-hash>` â€“ Switch between branches or commits  
- `merge <branch>` â€“ Merge another branch into the current one  
- `diff <commit1> <commit2>` â€“ Show line-by-line file differences
